In the beginning, there was the 7 note chant,

![do-re-mi-so-la-ti-do](images/Do-Re-Mi_(PSF).png)

and it was all the rave!

Which was 7 notes with the eighth being the octave,
or twice the frequency of the first note.

Then someone decided to write the music down,
and invented music theory!

Oh and just for confusion, octaves start on C.  
In Octave Notation [^1], which maps a note to a pitch (frequency), 
the notes of the white keys of a standard 88-key keyboard are:

A0 B0 C1 D1 E1 F1 G1 A1 B1 C2 D2 ... A7 B7 C8

With middle C (C4 on most instruments, can be C3, C4, or C5 on MIDI) 
being 261.626 Hz in the common A440 pitch standard (naturally there 
are other tuning [^2] standards).

But alas, musicians weren't satisfied with 7 notes,
so over time, settled on the natural base 12, i.e. 
12 notes per octave.  A 12 note scale is called a 
chromatic scale consisting of 12 semitones (or half 
steps or half tones) where the octave is divided into
approximate equal parts, i.e. equal temperament (can vary 
depending on tuning used).  2 semitones are a tone or whole step.

Unfortunately the grey beards insisted on keeping
the 7 note, or diatonic, scale so ended up inserting the 
extra 5 notes and calling them flats (half tone lower) or 
sharps (half tone higher), depending on usage, tradition, 
phase of the moon,...

To map 7 notes into twelve notes, the spacing is going to
have some variance as you need 5 whole tones and 2
half tones.  So how you arrange the whole and half
tones is called a mode [^3] or scale.

The natural scale, is the white keys of an octave starting
at C.  This gives a W-W-H-W-W-W-H tones for the C major scale
(or Ionian mode):

  C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
   
   W-W-H-W-W-W-H

This diatonic spacing of whole and half tones is movable
across the chromatic scale.  So a D major scale will have
the same tonal spacing (W-W-H-W-W-W-H) as the C major scale,
just starting on a D note.

  D-E-F♯-G-A-B-C♯-D

   W-W-H-W-W-W-H

An interval is a much abused term in music theory.  In music theory
an interval [^4] is technically the difference in pitch between two sounds.

On a guitar an interval [^5] is typically the distance from the root note of
a scale.  We can number these distances starting with 1 being the root
note, 2 being the second note in scale, etc.  So
the C major scale, C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C, becomes 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1
with the root note, 1, on C and has the same tonal spacing 
W-W-H-W-W-W-H.

  C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
  
  1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1
  
   W-W-H-W-W-W-H

The advantage of numerical intervals is chords, licks, rifs, etc have the
same number regardless of key.
