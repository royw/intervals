In the beggining, there was the 7 note chant,

and it was all the rave!

Which was 7 notes with the eighth being the octave,
or twice the frequency of the first note.

Then someone decided to write the music down,
and invented music theory!

But alas, musicians weren't satisfied with 7 notes,
so over time, settled on the natural base 12, i.e. 
12 notes per octave.  A 12 note scale is called a 
chromatic scale consisting of 12 semitones (or half 
steps or half tones) where the octave is divided into
approximate equal parts (can vary depending on tuning
used).  2 semitones are a tone or whole step.

Unfortunately the grey beards insisted on keeping
the 7 note, or diatonic, scale so ended up inserting the 
extra 5 notes and calling them flats or sharps.

To map 7 notes into twelve notes, the spacing is going to
have some variance as you need 5 whole tones and 2
half tones.  So how you arrange the whole and half
tones is called a mode.

The natual scale, is the white keys of an octave starting
at C.  This gives a W-W-H-W-W-W-H tones for C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
